  target = "_blank" title= "html5 speicifcation">These lists are the most frequent words</a>, when performing a simple, straight (obvious) frequency count of all the books found on Project Gutenberg.
  The list of books was downloaded in July 2005,
  and "rsynced" monthly thereafter. These are mostly English words, with some other languages finding representation to a lesser extent.

  <p style = "margin-top:40px;">Many Project Gutenberg books are scanned once their copyright expires, typically book editions published before 1923,
  so the language does not necessarily always represent current usage. For example,
  "thy" is listed as the 280th most common word. Also, with 24,000+ books,
   the text of the boilerplate warning for Project Gutenberg appears on each of them.
